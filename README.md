# sp-notification
Simple bash script to display a notification of the current playing Spotify song.

Best use would be binding it to a global key shortcut, for example &#8984; + S



Needs the following [script](https://gist.github.com/wandernauta/6800547) and `libnotify-bin` package for `notify-send` to work.
